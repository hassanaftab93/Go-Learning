# Module-2: Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go

## Week-1: Functions and Organization
Continue your exploration of the Go programming language as you learn about functions, methods, and interfaces. Topics include the implementation of functions, function types, object-orientation in Go, methods, and class instantiation. As with the first course in this series, you’ll have an opportunity to create your own Go applications so you can practice what you’re learning. The first module introduces the concept of functions and shows you how to use them to manipulate data programmatically. Once again, the treatment of the topic begins at a fairly rudimentary level to ensure everyone is starting from the same point in terms of basic concepts.
- Learning Objectives
  - Identify the basic features and purposes of functions.
  - Identify the benefits of using pointers when working with functions.
  - Identify the difference between passing a slice and an array as function arguments.
  - Use functions and a slice to implement a sorting routine for integers.

## Week-2: Function Types
This second module continues to explore the use of functions in Go. You’ll continue learning about the capabilities and features of functions, and write a routine that solves a practical physics problem.
- Learning Objectives
  - Identify advanced types, properties, and uses of functions.
  - Identify the output that would result from running a given code block containing functions.
  - Develop a routine containing functions in Go that solves a practical physics problem.

## Week-3: Object Orientation in Go
Functions in Go have many useful and powerful capabilities, which you’ll explore in this module. At the end, you’ll develop a Go routine that takes full advantage of Go’s object orientation.
- Learning Objectives
  - Identify the basic properties and uses of objects and classes.
  - Identify the differences between structs (in Go) and classes (in an object-oriented language).
  - Identify the uses of methods and different data types.
  - Develop an interactive Go routine that uses classes, objects, instances, structs, and methods to query the properties of existing instances.

## Week-4: Interfaces for Abstraction
This last module rounds out the course by introducing several new concepts including interfaces and polymorphism. You’ll finish the module – and course – by creating a Go routine that creates instances of a class and allows you to query its properties.
- Learning Objectives
  - Identify the basic characteristics and features of interfaces in Go.
  - Identify the characteristics of polymorphism.
  - Identify the features associated with overriding and inheritance.
  - Develop an interactive Go routine that uses classes, objects, instances, structs, and methods to create new class instances and later query their properties.
