//Functions

//Parameters and return Values

//Call by Value or Reference

//Passing arrays and slices

//Well written functions

/*
1. Understandability is Important
	1.1. If you are requested to find a feature, if found easily, then Code is understandable
	1.2. Where data is used/found, Traceability should be easy
	1.3. Maybe data is bad/wrong in a file being read, Issue should be traceable

2. Debugging Principles
	2.1. There are 2 Possibilities
		2.1.1. Function is written incorrectly (Logic needs to be revised, try Dry running)
		2.1.2. Maybe the Data being passed into the function is wrong. (Try tracing back, Console logs can help)

3. Supporting debugging
	3.1. Functions need to be understandable
	3.2. Is the function performing its purpose correctly?
	3.3. Data needs to be traceable
		3.3.1. Global Variable complicate this
		3.3.2. Try to code in a way such that all the data is going Func -> Func
*/

//Guidelines for functions

/*
1. Function Naming
	- Understandable names
	- Parameter names
	- Functional Cohesion is important | one Function should perfrom one Operation.
